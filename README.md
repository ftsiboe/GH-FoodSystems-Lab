# Household-Consumption-Expenditure-Ghana

Reliable and comprehensive nationwide household-level consumption and expenditure data is crucial for tracking poverty, hunger, nutrition, and health/well-being outcomes. Such data can also provide an evidence-based road map on how these issues can be addressed from a policy standpoint. Data collected via the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) provides Ghana with this avenue, yet the reports from them by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) neither consider the trends nor in-depth analysis of food consumption and nutrient availability beyond food expenditure. This paper sets the premise to fill this knowledge gap by harmonizing and generating nationally representative household-level food consumption and nutrient availability variables (price, quantities, and values) alongside consumption of non-food items and other household-level variables from the Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) fielded in 2005/06, 2012/13, and 2016/17. The harmonized data has the widest spatiotemporal and socioeconomic coverage of Ghanaian households. As such it presents a unique opportunity to empirically analyze key food consumption and nutrient availability phenomena at the household level.
