# GH-FoodSystemsLab: An Open Research Repository on Household Consumption, Food Poverty, and Market Integration in Ghana

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**GH-FoodSystemsLab** is a curated collection of data-driven research projects examining the interlinked themes of household consumption, food poverty, and market integration in Ghana and similar developing country contexts.

This repository brings together analytical tools, empirical datasets, and reproducible code to investigate how household-level factors and broader market dynamics shape food access, dietary diversity, and nutritional outcomes. The overarching aim is to generate rigorous, policy-relevant insights that support the development of resilient and equitable food systems.

## ðŸ“Š Data

The project utilizes farm-level data from the Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS), which are population-based surveys conducted periodically, approximately every five years, in Ghana: [GLSS1](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/7),  [GLSS2](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/4), [GLSS3](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/12), [GLSS4](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/14), [GLSS5](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/5), [GLSS6](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/72), and [GLSS7](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/97) These datasets offer rich longitudinal insights into consumption behavior, food security indicators, income sources, and market participation across diverse regions of Ghana.

## ðŸ§ª Methods

- **QUAIDS (Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System)** for modeling household food demand.
- **Matching Techniques** (e.g., propensity score and Mahalanobis distance matching) to reduce model dependency and mitigate self-selection bias. Refer to:  [Abadie & Imbens, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00655.x) and [Abadie & Imbens, 2016](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA11293)
